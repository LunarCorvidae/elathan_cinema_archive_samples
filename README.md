# Elathan_Cinema_Archive_Samples
An archive of selected writing samples from the defunct short film review blog Elathan Cinema.

## What license is this?

I have specifically not chosen a license for this project, as these are archival PDFs saved from a small blog I previously wrote for that is now defunct. As such, according to the GitHub documentation, the license is as follows: 

"You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work."

Please also be mindful of the dates listed on the PDFs, most if not all of these samples are from around 2017-2018 and are several years old. Links or other information in the PDF files might be old, outdated, or lead to other defunct areas of the internet. These are how the articles used to appear as run. 

Thank you for visiting my little window into the past.
